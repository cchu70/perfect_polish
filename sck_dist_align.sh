# Evaluate the kmer the distribution of unique single copy kmers in minimap alignments compared to the reads.
# We hope to show that:
	# 1) showing that reads with exactly have only one alignment have unique kmers (this approach is not losing anything)
	# 2) for reads that have multiple good alignments, minimapâ€™s primary choice is not always the same as the one that our 
	#    approach would pick (this approach is better for picking correct alignments)
	# 3) Reads that minimap drops contain unique kmers that can be used to map (this approach allows us to align more 
	#    reads accurately)
